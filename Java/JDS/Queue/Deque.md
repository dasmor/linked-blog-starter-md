Child of [[Queue]]

A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. The name _deque_ is short for "double ended queue" and is usually pronounced "deck". Most `Deque` implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.
